Case Study 1: Student Grading System
You are tasked with creating a Python program that manages a student grading system. The program should allow users to input student names, their respective scores, and calculate the average score for each student. Additionally, it should identify the top-scoring student and display their name. Implement this using Python's data structures and control flow mechanisms
Data structures:

Use a dictionary to store student names and their respective scores. The dictionary key would be the student name, and the dictionary value would be the student's score.
Use a list to store the average scores of all students.
Control flow mechanisms:
Use a for loop to iterate over the dictionary of student names and scores.
Use a conditional statement (e.g., an if-elif-else statement) to calculate the average score for each student based on their individual scores.
Use a conditional statement (e.g., an if-elif-else statement) to identify the top-scoring student by comparing the average scores of all students.
